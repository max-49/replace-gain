# Replace gain.wav

These are two scripts meant to replace the new sound CyberPatriot images play when gaining points with the old one that used to be played two years ago. 

These are in no way "checklists" or "scripts" meant to "gain points" on these images and I am also not liable if you manage to break these images with these scripts, so please **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**! 

I can assure you that I've tested these on my home computer and they do what they're supposed to, but I cannot guarantee they will work on CyberPatriot images. Before you use these scripts, make sure you understand everything that these scripts do, as these scripts must be run as Administrator or root and you should NOT trust random scripts on the internet anytime, especially when they require permissions.

This was just a fun way to get the nostalgia of the old CyberPatriot back ~~(ignoring the fact that I wasn't around when this sound was still being played but whatever)~~

Thanks to Elysium Suite for the old gain.wav file.

Thank you and reach out to me with any questions, you know who I am lol :)
